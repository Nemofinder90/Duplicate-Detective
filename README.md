# Duplicate Detective

Find and remove duplicate files within a chosen folder! This tool compares file *content*, so it finds identical files even if their names are different. It's useful for cleaning up any folder, including Sims 4 Mods/CC folders where renamed duplicates can occur.

## How to Use

1.  **Open the Application:** Find the `duplicate detective` folder (you might have unzipped it). Inside, double-click on `duplicate detective.exe` to start the program.
2.  **Select Folder:** Click the "Select Folder" button in the sidebar on the left. Choose the main folder you want to check for duplicates. The folder path will appear in the sidebar.
3.  **Scan:** Click the "Scan Selected Folder" button. A progress bar will show while the program reads your files. Please wait for it to finish.

5.  **Select Files for Deletion:**
    * Click on the duplicate files (the nested ones) you want to remove. Selected files will be highlighted.
    * OR click the "Select Dupes (Keep First)" button (bottom-right) to automatically select all the nested duplicates in the list.
